This repository contains a sample RFC (Request for Comments).

## Why RFCs?

RFCs are short proposal documents.  

They help engineering teams agree on new features, system changes, or process updates.  

In AI and product-led SaaS roles, RFCs are a key part of proposing and shaping new ideas.  

RFCs can:

- Frame problems with empathy for users

- Propose solutions with trade-offs and alternatives

- Consider risks, adoption, and long-term maintainability

- Document decisions and collaborate across engineering, product, and design  

- Design effective prompts for AI systems to deliver accurate, user-focused outputs
